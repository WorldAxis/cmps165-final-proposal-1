        <center><h1>The Environmental Costs of Goods</h1></center>
        
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <h4>Create an easy way to identify and compare the environmental costs of various products or types of products. Get a sense of the environmental costs of producing various products and services. Potentially compare the costs of those products to environmentally friendly alternatives.</h4>
        
        <h2>Potential Data Sources:</h2>
        <h4><a href="http://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/product-water-footprint-statistics/">Water Footprint Network</a>, water costs of various products. Several large data sets available.</h4>
        <h4><a href="https://www.cfp-japan.jp/calculate/verify/data.html">Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry</a>, uncertain as the data is provided only in Japanese.  Product carbon emmissions databases appear to be heavily privatized and hard to get, and when they aren't, they tend to be more country based than product based.</h4>
        <h4><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-11/documents/2014_smm_tablesfigures_508.pdf">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, sustainable materials management information, may be usable in determining recyclability.</h4>
